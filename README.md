# Troubleshooting common problems
Written by Joshua Merriman

--------

## What is this?
This is a repository of troubleshooting procedures, ranging from how to install Zscaler certificates, to how to trace network traffic.

It's set up in a **Git repository**, meaning anyone is free to submit corrections, changes, and fixes, as well as add new documents freely, while keeping a paper trail of who does what to the files.

## Why is this here?
I set up this central repository so that trainees can have a place to share and read documentation written by them or themselves. I *could* have used Google Docs, but GitHub is a lot easier to keep updated.
Plus, I eventually plan on sharing the scripts and programs I use at work here.
